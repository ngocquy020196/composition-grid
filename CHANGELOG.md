# Changelog

## v1.0.2 — 2026-03-22

### ✨ New Features

- **Site Mode** — Control where the grid appears with three modes:
  - **All Sites** — Grid works on every website (default)
  - **Block List** — Grid works everywhere except listed sites
  - **Allow List** — Grid only works on listed sites
- **Separate Block & Allow Lists** — Each mode maintains its own independent site list
- **Options Page** — Dedicated full-page settings with tabbed navigation (Settings + Allowed Sites)
- **Allowed Sites Button** — Quick access from popup to the options page site management tab
- **Additional Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Alt+D` — Toggle intersection dots
  - `Alt+L` — Switch between solid and dashed lines
- **Dynamic Context Menu** — Right-click menu automatically hides on blocked/disabled sites

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Grid Components Refactor** — Extracted grid overlays into dedicated component files (`StandardGrid`, `FibonacciSpiral`, `GoldenTriangle`, `IntersectionDot`)
- **Shared Settings Hook** — New `useSettings` hook with debounced saves to avoid Chrome storage rate limits
- **Smart Tab Reuse** — "Allowed Sites" button reuses existing options tab instead of opening duplicates
- **Cleaner Build Output** — Banner folder and `.DS_Store` excluded from `dist/`
- **Minimal Permissions** — Removed `activeTab` and `scripting` permissions; only requires `storage`, `contextMenus`, and `tabs`

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed `alert()` on blocked sites — replaced with hidden context menu
- Removed dead CSS classes (`.cg-grid-wrapper`, `.site-rules-row`, `.reset-link`)
- Removed unused code from previous iterations

### 📄 Docs & Landing Page

- Updated README with new features, project structure, settings table, and keyboard shortcuts
- Landing page: updated feature cards (Site Control, Keyboard Shortcuts), added Buy Me a Coffee and Privacy links to footer
- Added Edge shortcuts URL alongside Chrome in documentation
